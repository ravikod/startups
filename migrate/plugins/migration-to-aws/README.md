# Agent Skills for AWS Migration

AI agent skills for migrating workloads to AWS, built for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview) and [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/).

## What This Does

Point this plugin at your codebase, Terraform files, or GCP billing data. It runs a structured 6-phase migration assessment — discovering what you have, asking the right questions, designing the AWS architecture, estimating costs with real pricing data, and generating runnable migration artifacts.

**For AI-focused startups**, it goes further:

- **Detects your entire AI stack** — not just "you use GPT-4o" but your agents, tools, orchestration patterns, memory layers, and multi-model pipelines
- **Recommends three migration paths** for agentic workloads: retarget (keep your framework, swap models), AgentCore Harness (config-based managed agents), or Strands Agents (AWS-native multi-agent SDK)
- **Surfaces options you wouldn't find on your own** — like Strands Agents (open-source, powers AgentCore internally) and AgentCore Harness (declare an agent in 3 API calls)
- **Generates runnable artifacts** — `harness.json`, deployment scripts, incremental migration scripts, provider adapters — tailored to your specific models, tools, and architecture
- **Gives honest pricing comparisons** — Gives honest pricing comparisons — finds you the best Bedrock option for your workload with current April 2026 pricing data, including side-by-side cost comparisons against your existing OpenAI/Gemini spend

## What You Get That a Base LLM Can't Give You

| Capability               | Base LLM                          | This Plugin                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Model recommendation     | Generic "use Bedrock"             | Your specific models mapped with pricing, honest assessment per model, stay-or-migrate recommendation                                                 |
| Agentic migration        | "Swap ChatOpenAI for ChatBedrock" | Detects your framework, agents, tools, orchestration pattern. Recommends retarget vs Harness vs Strands with effort ranges.                           |
| Multi-model coordination | Generic advice                    | Warns about re-embedding requirements, cascade pair testing, tiered strategies — based on your actual model usage                                     |
| Framework gotchas        | Not covered                       | Documents real issues: LangGraph checkpointer incompatibility, CrewAI hierarchical process failures with smaller models, async thread pool exhaustion |
| Regional validation      | Outdated region lists             | Live `get_regional_availability` MCP call — catches "AgentCore Harness isn't in your target region" before you commit                                 |
| Cost estimation          | Stale pricing                     | Three-tier pricing: cached current rates, live AWS Pricing API, fallback. Shows ±5-10% accuracy.                                                      |
| Generated code           | Generic templates                 | Your model IDs, your tool names, your system prompts, your region — in runnable scripts                                                               |
| Incremental migration    | Not suggested                     | Run existing OpenAI models on AgentCore infrastructure today, A/B test with Bedrock per-invocation, swap when confident                               |

## Installation

### Claude Code

```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add aws-samples/sample-agent-skills-for-aws-migration

# Install the plugin
/plugin install migration-to-aws@sample-agent-skills-for-aws-migration
```

### Cursor

> **Coming soon** — This plugin is not yet published on the Cursor Marketplace. In the meantime, you can use it locally by cloning this repository and pointing Cursor to the plugin directory.

## migration-to-aws

### Workflow

1. **Discover** — Scan Terraform files, application code, and/or billing data. Detects GCP resources, AI models, agentic frameworks, tools, and orchestration patterns.
2. **Clarify** — Ask targeted questions about migration preferences, AI priorities, agentic migration approach, memory requirements, and timeline.
3. **Design** — Map GCP services to AWS equivalents. For AI workloads: select Bedrock models with honest pricing comparison. For agentic workloads: design AgentCore Harness config or Strands architecture.
4. **Estimate** — Calculate monthly AWS costs using real-time pricing data. Compare to current GCP/OpenAI spend.
5. **Generate** — Create migration artifacts: Terraform, provider adapters, `harness.json`, deployment scripts, incremental migration scripts, and documentation.
6. **Feedback** _(optional)_ — Collect anonymized feedback to improve the tool.

## Requirements

- Claude Code >=2.1.29 or [Cursor >= 2.5](https://cursor.com/changelog/2-5)
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- At least one input source: Terraform files, application code, or GCP billing data
- **For AI/agentic migration:** Application source code is required (billing/IaC alone cannot detect agent architecture)

## Development

This project uses [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) for tool management and task running.

```bash
# Install tools
mise install

# Run the full build (lint, format, validate, security)
mise run build

# Individual tasks
mise run lint          # All linters (markdown, manifests, cross-refs)
mise run fmt           # Format with dprint
mise run fmt:check     # Check formatting
mise run security      # All security scanners
```

### Evaluating Changes

Prompt files are the source code of this plugin. Changes to files under
`features/migration-to-aws/skills/gcp-to-aws/` can alter migration behavior
in subtle ways. Run the evaluation harness before submitting a PR:

```bash
# 1. Quick structural check (instant, no Claude API calls)
mise run eval:check

# 2. Run the migration skill against a test fixture (see table below)
cd tests/fixtures/<FIXTURE_NAME>
# In Claude Code: "migrate from GCP to AWS"

# 3. Validate the output
python tools/eval_check.py \
  --migration-dir .migration/<RUN_ID> \
  --fixture <FIXTURE_NAME>

# 4. Commit results
git add .eval-results.json
```

#### Test Fixtures

Pick the fixture that covers your change area. For broad changes, run
`minimal-cloud-run-sql` first, then any fixture specific to your change.
