```

### Cursor

> **Coming soon** — Plugins are not yet published on the Cursor Marketplace.

## Repository Structure

Each top-level folder is owned by a team and contains their plugins, tools, or resources:

```
awslabs/startups/
├── .claude-plugin/marketplace.json   # Plugin marketplace (lists all plugins)
├── migrate/                          # Migration tools and plugins
└── ...                               # Future team folders
```

## Adding a Plugin

To add a new plugin to the marketplace:

1. Create your plugin under your team's folder (e.g., `migrate/plugins/my-plugin/`)
1. Include a `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest in your plugin directory
1. Add an entry to the root `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "source": "./my-team-folder/plugins/my-plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "What your plugin does"
}
```

1. Submit a PR — requires approval from `@awslabs/startups-admins` (for marketplace changes) and your team's CODEOWNERS (for plugin content)
