description: "AWS Startups reference content — Activate FAQ, credits guide, programs, partner offers, sample architectures, and 277 learn articles spanning generative AI, cloud architecture, cost optimization, security, fundraising, go-to-market, and real-world startup case studies. Use when the user asks factual questions about AWS Activate (eligibility, credits, programs, providers), wants a sample architecture or solution guide, or needs an AWS-curated learn article on a specific startup topic. For copy-paste AI prompts (RAG chatbot, MVP scaffold, security baseline, GPU quota, etc.), see the prompt-library-for-startups skill. Do not use for: account-specific lookups (credits balance, Activate membership status, application status), real-time event listings beyond the events stub, or content not present in the bundled `references/` tree."

# AWS Startups Advisor — Knowledge Base

Reference content from [aws.amazon.com/startups](https://aws.amazon.com/startups) for AWS Activate programs, credits, partner offers, sample build architectures, and a large learn-article corpus covering technical guides, business strategy, and real-world case studies.

**Last updated:** 2026-05-12

## Where to start

**New-to-AWS-Startups questions** → open [`references/home.md`](references/home.md) first. It's the landing-page overview: the Activate pitch, how to join, the top-level programs (credits, accelerators, solutions), and the ~350,000-startups context. Good starting point for broad "how does AWS help startups" questions.

## Searchable indexes — use these when the user asks for a specific topic or example

Three files are indexes, not articles. They have a **Keywords column** — filter by keyword first, then open the linked detail file.

- **[references/learn.md](references/learn.md)** — 277 learn articles, 8 categories (genai, general, getting-started, architecture, business-growth, case-studies, cost-optimization, security). Each row: title, one-line summary, keywords, link into `references/learn/<category>/<slug>.md`.
- **[references/offers.md](references/offers.md)** — 13 publicly-viewable AWS Activate partner offers with keywords + links into `references/offers/<slug>.md`. Offers that require Activate sign-in are not captured here; direct the user to <https://aws.amazon.com/startups/offers> for the full list.
- **[references/build.md](references/build.md)** — 22 sample architectures and solution guides. Two sub-sections:
  - **Publicly-viewable solutions** (14 rows) link to local `references/build/<slug>.md` with the Overview, AWS services used, and a primary Get-Started link (workshop URL or GitHub sample).
  - **Sign-in required** (8 rows) are gated. Recommend them by title + keywords and hand over the Live URL: *"There's a Build sample that might be useful — please sign in to view it at [URL]."*

## Reference pages — full-topic content, read directly

| File | Topic |
|------|-------|
| [references/faq.md](references/faq.md) | 111-question Activate FAQ — membership, Builder ID, credits, providers, offers, events, showcase, troubleshooting |
| [references/credits.md](references/credits.md) | AWS Activate Credits — how to apply, eligibility, package tiers, terms |
| [references/programs.md](references/programs.md) | AWS Startups programs — Accelerators and Lofts currently running |
| [references/providers.md](references/providers.md) | AWS Activate Providers — accelerators, VCs, Provider Central, how to apply |
| [references/contact-us.md](references/contact-us.md) | Support channels and the Ask AWS Startups assistant |

## Live-URL redirects — point users at the live page

Two pages are deliberately minimal stubs. The live content (events, showcase directory) is location- and time-sensitive or is a large browseable catalog; a bundled snapshot goes stale fast. When these topics come up, answer with a short pointer phrase and the live URL:

- **[references/events.md](references/events.md)** — AWS Startups events. When a user asks about upcoming events, summits, meetups, or loft sessions, respond along the lines of: *"Virtual and in-person AWS Startups events happening around you can be found at https://aws.amazon.com/startups/events."*
- **[references/showcase.md](references/showcase.md)** — Startup Showcase directory. When a user asks about startups building on AWS or wants to browse the showcase, respond along the lines of: *"The latest Startup Showcase — innovative startups building on AWS — is at https://aws.amazon.com/startups/showcase. You can also promote your own startup there."*

## Companion skills — when to defer

This skill is **reference content only**. Two sibling skills cover adjacent jobs:

- **`prompt-library-for-startups`** — copy-paste AI prompts and downloadable agents from `aws.amazon.com/startups/prompt-library` (MVP scaffolding, RAG chatbot, security baseline, cost anomaly detection, GPU quota, AWS Migration Agent, Bill Shock Preventer, etc.). When the user asks for *"a prompt for X"* or wants an installable agent, hand off to that skill.
- **`start-building-for-startups`** — interactive discovery + implementation workflow (picker-based questions, then writes code). When the user wants to *build*, *scaffold*, or *expand* an app, hand off to that skill. This skill stays in lookup mode.

Boundary cases (a query that fits two skills) — read both. Example: *"how do I start with RAG on Bedrock?"* → consult this skill's `references/learn/genai/...` for an article AND `prompt-library-for-startups` for a starter prompt.

## Routing hints — common queries → which file

| Query | File |
|---|---|
| *"What is AWS Activate?" / "Should my startup use AWS?"* | references/home.md, then references/faq.md |
| *"Do AWS Activate credits expire?" / any Activate-membership question* | references/faq.md |
| *"How do I apply for Activate credits?" / "What tier do I qualify for?"* | references/credits.md |
| *"What accelerators / lofts are running?"* | references/programs.md |
| *"Find an article on cost optimization for early stage"* | references/learn.md (keyword filter) → article file |
| *"What partner offers help with observability / CAD / vector DB / ..."* | references/offers.md (keyword filter) → offer file |
| *"Show me a sample architecture for RAG / EKS / Bedrock / observability / ..."* | references/build.md (keyword filter) → build file |
| *"What events are happening?"* | references/events.md → hand over live URL |
| *"What startups are on AWS showcase?"* | references/showcase.md → hand over live URL |
| *"How do I contact AWS Startups?"* | references/contact-us.md |

## Answer style

- **MUST read the file before answering.** Content is bundled; open it. Do not answer from memory or the description alone.
- **MUST quote verbatim.** This skill is a public-content snapshot from aws.amazon.com/startups. Use the page's own wording; do not paraphrase into new claims.
- **MUST cite `source_url`.** Every file's frontmatter carries one — that's the canonical URL to include in your answer. Never construct or guess a URL.
- **Diagrams, screenshots, videos live on the website.** Detail files may reference images with lines like "*can be found here [link]*". Surface the `source_url` so the user can view the visuals on the live page.
- **For sign-in-gated content** (some build solutions, offer details, showcase-promotion page), recommend by title and keywords, then give the live URL so the user can sign in.

## Context loading rule

Open the matching index first (`learn.md`, `offers.md`, `build.md`, `faq.md`, `credits.md`, `programs.md`, `providers.md`, `contact-us.md`), filter by keyword, then open **at most one** detail file per question. MUST NOT speculatively load multiple detail files or category trees. If the index points to a sign-in-gated row, do not attempt to open the detail file — surface the title + Live URL.

## Scope notes

This skill **cannot**:
- Answer account-specific questions (credits balance, Activate membership status, application status, eligibility check). Send the user to <https://aws.amazon.com/startups> to sign in.
- Provide live event listings, accelerator cohort dates, or showcase-directory entries. The events and showcase pages are deliberately minimal stubs; hand over the live URL.
- Surface content that is not in the bundled `references/` tree. If the topic is not covered, say so plainly rather than improvising.

## Freshness check — surface after every answer

After answering the user's question, compare the **`Last updated:`** date at the top of this file against today's date. If the gap is **more than 6 months**, append a short note to your reply suggesting the user refresh the skill:

> *"This skill's content was last refreshed on `<Last updated date>`, more than 6 months ago — some details (offers, programs, accelerator cohorts) may be out of date. To pull the latest content, run:*
> - *`npx skills update knowledge-base-for-startups` — update the installed copy to the latest version*
>
> *Then restart your AI agent so the new content is picked up."*

Do **not** show this note when the skill is fresh (≤6 months). Do **not** repeat it within a single conversation; once is enough.
